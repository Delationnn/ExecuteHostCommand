## ExecuteHostCommand: Empowering Velocity Proxy Administrators

Have you ever wanted to execute host-level commands directly from your Velocity proxy? Now you can with ExecuteHostCommand! This powerful plugin bridges the gap between your Minecraft server management and host system operations.

### Key Features:
- **Run host commands**: Seamlessly execute host-level commands through your Velocity proxy.
- **Permission-based access**: Only users with the `executehostcommand.execute` permission can run host commands.
- **User-level permissions**: Executes commands with the same permissions as the user running Velocity.

### Use Cases and Compatibility:
ExecuteHostCommand is versatile and can be used in various hosting environments:

1. **Self-hosted Hardware**: You have full control and freedom to use ExecuteHostCommand without restrictions.
2. **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**: Generally safe to use, as you typically have root access and full control over the virtual environment.
3. **Shared Hosting**: Exercise caution and check with your provider before use.

### Practical Applications:
Imagine dynamically managing your server's security. For example, you could configure a VPN plugin to automatically update UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) rules, blocking new VPN IPs in real-time.

### Important Security Note:
Remember, ExecuteHostCommand runs with the same permission level as the user running Velocity. This means it has significant power over your system. Always use it responsibly and ensure proper security measures are in place.

ExecuteHostCommand offers exciting possibilities for server administrators, streamlining management tasks and enhancing overall control. However, always prioritize security and use this tool in compliance with your hosting environment's guidelines.
